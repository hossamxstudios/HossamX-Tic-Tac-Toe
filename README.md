# HossamX-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe". It is a simple, text-based version of the game without a graphical user interface (GUI), designed to be played in a command-line interface or a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Features
- **Simple Text-Based Interface**: The game is played in a text console, making it easy to understand and play.
- **Two-Player Mode**: The game allows two players to compete against each other.
- **Dynamic Board Update**: The board is updated in real-time after each move, providing a clear view of the game state.

## Requirements
To run this game, you need:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Access to a command-line interface (terminal) or a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Installation
No additional installation is required. Just ensure Python 3.x is set up on your system.

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the Tic Tac Toe Python script or Jupyter Notebook file to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal (or Jupyter Notebook) and navigate to the directory containing the game file.
3. Run the file:
   - If in a terminal, type `python tic_tac_toe.py` (replace `tic_tac_toe.py` with the name of your Python script).
   - If in a Jupyter Notebook, simply run all cells in the notebook.
4. The game will start, and players can take turns entering their moves.

## Game Rules
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their marker (X or O) on the grid.
- The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If the grid is filled and no player has achieved this alignment, the game is a tie.
